# 1. Element naming convention (`data-testid`)

This webapp identifies significant DOM elements with the **`data-testid`**
attribute. It is the single, canonical way to name an element — for tests,
for browser/devtools targeting, and for referring to a part of the UI
precisely in conversation ("the curation panel" → `[data-testid="curation-panel"]`).

We deliberately do **not** add `id` attributes for this purpose. `id` must be
unique per document, so repeated elements (chips, list rows, table rows) can't
carry a static one; `data-testid` has no such restriction and already covers the
whole app (600+ usages). One vocabulary, no second system to keep in sync.

## 1.1 Rules

- Use `data-testid="kebab-case-name"` (not the short `data-test=` — that legacy
  spelling was standardized away in the storylines files).
- Name **areas, panels, toolbars, and named action buttons** — the things you'd
  point at when describing the page. Don't blanket every element.
- For repeated elements, give the **container** a stable name and let the
  repeated item share one (e.g. `chapter-chip` on each chip); disambiguate by
  position or by interpolating an id into the attribute
  (`:data-testid="`anchor-editor-remove-${entity.id}`"`).
- The Vitest suite selects on `data-testid`, so renaming one means updating its
  selectors in the same change.

## 1.2 Storylines detail view (`/storylines/N`) — key names

Reference map for `StorylineDetailView.vue` after the 2026-06-15 layout change
(chapters moved from a left rail to a horizontal `flex-wrap` strip below the
anchors row, so the two-panel reader uses the full width):
